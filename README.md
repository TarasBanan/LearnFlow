## About

This repository contains a monorepo scaffold of LearnFlow with:

- **`apps/web`** — Next.js App Router frontend
- **`apps/api`** — TypeScript API skeleton
- **`packages/shared`** — shared schema/types package

The frontend currently includes product-shaped placeholder pages and flows to validate IA, layout, and navigation before full backend integration.

## Core Features

- Course catalog with filters and product cards
- Course details pages with richer marketing copy
- Lesson player placeholder with lesson navigation
- My Learning area with progress and certificate access
- Quiz page placeholder with timer/submit actions
- Cart/checkout placeholder
- Author dashboard placeholder
- **Interactive course builder MVP** (add lesson, publish status, draft curriculum)
- Clickability contract checks for links/buttons

## Development Notes

- Course content is currently fixture-based (`apps/web/lib/courses.ts`).
- API/business logic are intentionally scaffold-level placeholders.
- The UI structure is ready for wiring real backend modules next.

---

## Roadmap

- Replace placeholder screenshots with real UI captures
- Wire catalog/course pages to API
- Implement authentication and role guards
- Implement payment flow and webhook-driven enrollment
- Implement lesson progress persistence and certificate generation
- Add e2e tests for key user journeys
